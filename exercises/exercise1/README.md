# Exercise 1 - Results

## Part 1 - Image Classification
Training accuracy running the image_classification with standard
parameters and seed of 42 results in accuracy: 23.110%.

## Part 2 - Using Adam Optimizer
Changing to Adam optimizer we get accuracy: 59.470%

## Part 3 - Replacing Leaky ReLU with Tanh
This results in accuracy: 18.850%

## Part 4 - Visualize using TensorBoard
Using TensorBoard we get the following train/val/test plots:
